#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
select count(orderID)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderID) = 6
and orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
Select count(orderID)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderID) = 6
and orderID <> 'OrderID'
and Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
select distinct acctnum
from BIT_DB.customers cust
inner join BIT_DB.FebSales feb
on cust.order_id = feb.orderID
where length(orderID) = 6
and orderID <> 'OrderID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
select distinct Product, min(price)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
order by price
limit 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select SUM(Quantity)*price as product_revenue, Product
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select Product, SUM(Quantity) as Quantity, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select count(distinct acctnum)as customers, avg(quantity*price) as average_spent
from BIT_DB.FebSales feb
left join BIT_DB.customers cust
on cust.order_id = feb.orderID
where Quantity > 2
and length(orderID) = 6
and orderID <> 'Order ID';
